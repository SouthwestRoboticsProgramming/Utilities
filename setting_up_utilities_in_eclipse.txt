1. Clone this repo somewhere NOT in your eclipse project directory

2. Create a NEW Eclipse project named Utilities, removing the default 'src' dir from the source path and link 
the JavaUtil folder in here as the sole source path folder

3. Add the WPILibJ JARs to the build path of your new project (I reccomend setting them up as a User Library)

4. Add the CTRE CANTalon JARs to the build path
5. Add other miscellaney to the build path
6. Export the entire linked source folder to ~/wpilib/user/java/lib/Utils2129.jar (you'll have to do this when you make changes, you can set up a jarspec)
7. Clone the source of the new robot project somewhere
8. AFTER the Utils2129.jar is created, create a new robot project and repeat the src shuffle to link it's src folder to the git repo
9. Open build.properties in the new eclipse project and set a new property src.dir=some\\path\\to\\repo\\src
