1. Clone this repo somewhere NOT in your eclipse project directory
2. Create a NEW Eclipse project named Utilities, removing the default 'src' dir from the source path and link 
the JavaUtil folder in here as the sole source path folder
3. Add the WPILibJ JARs to the build path of your new project (I reccomend setting them up as a User Library)
4. Add the CTRE CANTalon JARs to the build path
